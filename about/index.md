## More 

I love hobby photography. I've created my Flickr account in early 2009. I also love pets. I have three cats and a dog and some birds. My favorite book is The interpretation of dreams by Sigmund Freud. I created my first website at the age of approximately 12. I absolutely loved using the legendary Microsoft Frontpage and Adobe Illustrator. It's just not the same today! I remember spending days in front of my PC often forgetting to eat. Those websites were about my first pets: our old dog (â€  2008), cottage cats and my pet rabbit! Perhaps I'd love to do webdesign some day again.
